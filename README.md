## Description
The purpose of this challenge was to use Javascript to create a randomized password based on user input. I started out with outlining what I wanted Javascript to do, and then I pseudo coded some basic logic. <br>The biggest challenge I faced was validating user input.

<!-- what i learned -->
## What I learned
I learned about [Computational Thinking](https://ctpdonline.org/computational-thinking/) and how to implement it into my design process. I learned how to integrate Javascript objects with logic to get desired results.

## Future Development
I would like to integrate more user input validation to be able to catch floating numbers. <br>I would also like to create a function that would automatically copy the password to the users clipboard.
